# hashicat-azure-modules
show off our modules capabilities on Azure

## Steps to running the demo

1. Show the modules section and show how you add a module and different versions
2. Walk through Design Configuration and show the preview code
3. Rename the main.tf.start file to main.tf in VCS and show the code that is very similar to the preview code
4. Commit and push. This deploys a web app on a container into Azure's App Service
5. Show the app via the link that shows up in the Apply log
6. Destroy the environment
